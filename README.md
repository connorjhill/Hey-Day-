## History of Hey Day

This script is written to mimic the "Hey Day" tradition at Auburn. The tradition was created in 1947 and students were returning from fighting in WWII and they found it difficult to unnoticed by the rest of the student body. In order to fix this problem the student body and SGA created "Hey Day" where students gave out name tags and encourged the students to greet everyone. The tradtion has continued since then and is always on October 12th. To read more about Hey Day read this article:
